  <h1> Cal U'Ren's Static Website</h1>
  <p>Have you ever been <em>mesmerized</em> before? If you’ve never witnessed greatness then you’re in for a treat. This is arguably the greatest HTML website known to mankind. The code is written with precision and eloquence and maintains a visual aesthetic similar to Michelangelo’s paintbrush.</p>

  <h1>WRIT 5662 Artifacts</h1>
  <p>This class forced me to develop new skills and challenged me to view digital content from the users' perspective. It also showed me the importance of formulating work that can be reused and adapted before dissemination.

    <h2>DITA/XML Structured Authoring</h2>
    <p>XML allows one set of content to be developed into multiple outputs. Content is written in small, tagged chunks to facilitate reuse across multiple documents and formats. The code structure defines different types of information, specifically those that are frequently used by technical communicators. For my DITA files, I chose beginner Spanish lessons since they provided a topic with task, concept and reference information. Below you will find two different output formats for my final DITA files.</p>

    <h2>Adobe XD Wireframes</h2>
    <p>A strong web presence is critical for success irregarless of the industry. For our client project, I took it upon myself to develop "wireframes" for our new iteration of the MN Healey Club's website. Wireframes provide a conceptual and stylistic framework to build your code upon. I utilized Adobe XD to visualize our team's ideas, and as you can see through the examples, it was a constant work in progress as we finalized ideas and came to a consensus. The wireframes show progression of thought and subsequent progression of design.</p>
