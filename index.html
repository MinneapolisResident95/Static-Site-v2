  <h1> Cal U'Ren's Static Website</h1>
  <p>Writing With Digital Technologies was a somewhat transformative class for me as I gained new skills and insights into the world of web design. My original digital literacy narrative demonstrated that much of my digital education had been self taught. Due to the nature of online courses, this is still the case, however, the resources provided by Dr. Card and my peers were helpful when I got stuck. I now have an entire folder in my bookmarks section with different resources for HTML, CSS, XML and much more.</p>
  <br>
  <h1>Digital Literacy Narrative v2</h1>
    <p>Coming into this course, I hadn't had experience with a coding language in over a decade. It has been extremely challenging at times but also quite rewarding. I have a newfound respect for the tech industry and everyone that has helped advance the internet to what it is today. In general, I've been trying to consume less digital technology than I did during my adolescence. This is largely because I spend 10 or more hours everyday looking at some kind of computer screen for work or school. I have always loved reading, as stated in v1 of my digital literacy narrative, and now I'm hoping to get back into constant reading and writing in my free time. I hope to use this class a foundation for my HTML and CSS skills, which I will use somewhat consistenly for my job, and as a kickstarter for a static portfolio. I'm satisfied with those two major takeaways and I'm confident that I'll continue to build upon the foundation I gained in WRIT 5662.</p>

  <h2>Conceptual Skills I've Gained</h2>
  
  
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Content Authoring for Reusability</strong></dt>
    <dd>I was unaware and naive about how challening content reuse was. It's a technical communicator's responsibility to ensure that content can be altered, replicated and disseminated easily. This is becoming standard practice. Our course readings and LavaCon presentations demonstrated this well and I almost feel guilty for not considering it beforehand.</dd>
    <br>
    <p2><strong>A few key takeaways:</strong></p2>
    <ul>
      <li>Organize and link topics to create a coherent web of information. When you write in topics, it’s easier and more productive for multiple writers to contribute to the larger set of information.</li>
      <li>Write only one procedure per task topic so that you can easily manage, organize and reuse topics and so that your users can find specific tasks when they need them.</li>
      <li>Before you write task topics, be sure you understand your audience and their goals. Don’t write task topics that focus on how the product works.</li>
      <li>Use consistent formatting in topics that contain similar information.</li>
      </dl>  
    <br> 
    <dl>  
    <dt><strong>Web Design and Layout</strong></dt>
    <dd>Previously, I had only used Wix and Wordpress templates to build my websites. I have tons of experience crafting layouts through Adobe InDesign, particularly for fact sheets and print collateral, but I hadn't applied those skills to a website. The "box model" was familiar to me and I already felt comfortable establishing hierarchies of information, but this was often done without accompanying visual assets like photos or videos. Working with flexible layouts completely changes the game and it's been cool to learn about.</dd>
      <br>
      <p2><strong>A few key takeaways:</strong></p2>
      <br>
       <ul>
      <li>Front-load the important information. The journalism model of the “inverted pyramid" starts with the content that is most important to your audience, and then provide additional details.</li>
         <li>When writing for the web, use plain language that allows users to find what they need, understand what they have found and allows them to use it to meet their needs. It should be actionable, findable and shareable.</li></ul>
  </dl>
  <br>
  <h2>Conceptual Skills I've Augmented</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Collaboration Between Multiple Versions of a Project</strong></dt>
    <dd>Everyone is on the internet nowadays, making it imperative that you understand your unique audience's needs and capabilities. I've gained a better understanding of how to look at content from someone else's perspective, as well as how to recognize my own bias when creating content.</dd>  
    <br>
    <dt><strong>User Analysis</strong></dt>
    <dd>Everyone is on the internet nowadays, making it imperative that you understand your unique audience's needs and capabilities. I've gained a better understanding of how to look at content from someone else's perspective, as well as how to recognize my own bias when creating content.</dd>
    <br>
     <p2><strong>A few key takeaways:</strong></p2>
    <ul><li>Many companies aren’t doing their due diligence of making that content accessible for persons with disabilities. From headlines and form fields, to the use of images and color contact, the majority of websites today are not Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. I've been guilty of this in my own work and it's sad that this wasn't even something I considered before this class. It seems like this should be in every "introduction" course for digital technologies. This is something I should've had in v1 of my personal learning narrative, but unfortunately it wasn't brought to my attention.</li>
      <li>People are bombarded with information each day and there's increased saturation in the digital world. It's up to technical communicators to maximize their audience's attention and retention.</li></ul>
    <br>
    <h2>My Future Writing with Digital Technology</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Personal Portfolio</strong></dt>
    <dd>I plan to use this static website as a building block for a personal portfolio. The static site will likely be linked to my Wix portfolio and will serve as a representation of my coding abilities. I do not want it to be my "landing page" or the first thing that a potential employer/client sees since I don't think my HTML/CSS skills are robust enough to do so, however, it demonstrates that I do have some skill in my back pocket and that's my real intention. I'm not sure what a static site is fully capable of. I'd love to embed videos or incorporate a photography gallery if possible, but that will be a challenge for the future.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><strong>HTML and CSS in My Workspace</strong></dt>
    <dd>I often make simple web edits to several University of Minnesota websites and I hope to become a more reliable editor. In the past, for anything that was complex or that contained several elements, I would rely on our web manager for assistance. Perhaps it was just a confidence issue and I had the skill all along, but either way, I hope to add "web editing" to my resume and have the experience to back it up. I've learned about "padding" in CSS, but this <strong>will not</strong> be padding a resume. </dd>

  <h1>WRIT 5662 Artifacts</h1>
  <p>This class forced me to develop new skills and challenged me to view digital content from the users' perspective. It also showed me the importance of formulating work that can be reused and adapted before dissemination.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>DITA/XML Structured Authoring</h2>
    <p>XML allows one set of content to be developed into multiple outputs. Content is written in small, tagged chunks to facilitate reuse across multiple documents and formats. The code structure defines different types of information, specifically those that are frequently used by technical communicators. For my DITA files, I chose beginner Spanish lessons since they provided a topic with task, concept and reference information. Below you will find the code for my <strong>concept topic</strong> (left), <strong>task topic</strong> (middle) and <strong>reference topic</strong> (right). The button contains a PDF output which will show you the final product.</p>

    <h1>Adobe XD Wireframes</h1>
    <p>A strong web presence is critical for success irregarless of the industry. For our client project, I took it upon myself to develop "wireframes" for our new iteration of the MN Healey Club's website. Wireframes provide a conceptual and stylistic framework to build your code upon. I utilized Adobe XD to visualize our team's ideas, and as you can see through the examples, it was a constant work in progress as we finalized ideas and came to a consensus. The wireframes show progression of thought and subsequent progression of design.</p>
