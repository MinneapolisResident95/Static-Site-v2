  <h1> Cal U'Ren's Static Website</h1>
  <p>Writing With Digital Technologies was a somewhat transformative class for me as I gained new skills and insights into the world of web design. My original digital literacy narrative demonstrated that much of my digital education had been self taught. Due to the nature of online courses, this is still the case, however, the resources provided by Dr. Card and my peers were helpful when I got stuck. I now have an entire folder in my bookmarks section with different resources for HTML, CSS, XML and much more.</p>

  <h1>WRIT 5662 Artifacts</h1>
  <p>This class forced me to develop new skills and challenged me to view digital content from the users' perspective. It also showed me the importance of formulating work that can be reused and adapted before dissemination.

    <h2>DITA/XML Structured Authoring</h2>
    <p>XML allows one set of content to be developed into multiple outputs. Content is written in small, tagged chunks to facilitate reuse across multiple documents and formats. The code structure defines different types of information, specifically those that are frequently used by technical communicators. For my DITA files, I chose beginner Spanish lessons since they provided a topic with task, concept and reference information. Below you will find the code for my <strong>concept topic</strong> (left), <strong>task topic</strong> (middle) and <strong>reference topic</strong> (right). The button contains a PDF output which will show you the final product.</p>

    <h1>Adobe XD Wireframes</h1>
    <p>A strong web presence is critical for success irregarless of the industry. For our client project, I took it upon myself to develop "wireframes" for our new iteration of the MN Healey Club's website. Wireframes provide a conceptual and stylistic framework to build your code upon. I utilized Adobe XD to visualize our team's ideas, and as you can see through the examples, it was a constant work in progress as we finalized ideas and came to a consensus. The wireframes show progression of thought and subsequent progression of design.</p>
